# Zoid Lesson

This lesson is to help explain and demo zoid (previously know as xcomponent).

## What is Zoid?

Zoid allows cross-domain messaging, also know as, post messaging. Zoid is built on a framework called
<br/>
[post-robot](https://github.com/krakenjs/post-robot), which allows simple post messaging. Zoid attempts to make this more robust.

Below, we will cover how to implement a demo for Zoid and try to ramp things up to more complex examples.
